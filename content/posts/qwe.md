Building beautiful websites means getting a lot of little things right.

Typography. Spacing. Repetition. Color. Contrast. Images. Hierarchy. Responsiveness. Alignment.

Beauty means the right building blocks, assembled correctly. Beauty requires creativity, not just the absence of flaws. Beauty needs consistency; it’s broken by perennial one-off adjustments. A beautiful website isn’t just the finished, loaded page; it’s also the process of getting there.

### Create beautifully-designed, reusable components

Because Gatsby is built on React, you can easily integrate component-based design systems into your website development process. Forget reinventing the wheel in five different CMS frameworks — with a component library, your design team can focus on creating one beautiful version of each component, which your development team can then use everywhere.

### Easily create clean, consistent typography

Crafting a look and feel that’s consistent and reflects brand personality is key for content-driven sites. Yet often designers can be removed from the development process.

With Gatsby’s built-in Typography.js integration, it’s easy for designers and developers to collaborate on header ratios, font size and line spacing rhythm across your whole site, while preventing text styling from devolving into a series of one-off CSS modifications without a coherent theme.
