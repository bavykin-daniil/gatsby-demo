pagetitle: Forestry — A CMS for Git
description: Forestry.io is a Git-backed CMS (content management system) for websites
  and web products built using static site generators. Forestry bridges the gap between
  developers and their teams, by making development fun and easy.

Content Management Systems (CMS) are important components of web sites used for managing and creating posts, text content, titles, graphics and other content used by a website. Forestry takes a different spin on CMS by using git service providers as the backend storage system. This design choice has other benefits as well though. One key benefit being the ability to track version changes in files and content. The same way developers benefit from GIT’s branches, merging and isolated versions while working on source code together, Forestry allows content creators to benefit from the same set of features while add new material to their sites.

### Connect to a Git Service Provider

The first step when diving into Forestry is to choose a Git Service Provider. The two largest of which are debatably Github and Gitlab. Forestry will sync changes to your site by committing changes back to your git repository once connected with OAuth.
